/**
 * WooCommerce customers — server only.
 *
 * ## Two different things were sharing one screen
 *
 * The console's Customers page read Supabase `profiles`: rows that exist because
 * someone signed up. That is an *identity* list, not a customer list — it cannot
 * answer "who bought something", which is the only question a commerce console's
 * customer page is for. Identity (accounts, roles, sign-in) is a separate concern
 * and stays on Users; this module reads the store's own customer records, which
 * is where order history and spend live.
 *
 * ## Why the totals are not computed here
 *
 * WooCommerce reports `orders_count` and `total_spent` on the customer record
 * itself. Recomputing them by summing orders would be a second implementation of
 * WooCommerce's own accounting (it excludes refunds, cancelled orders and
 * trashed ones by its own rules), and the two would disagree the first time an
 * order was refunded. The store's numbers are used as reported.
 *
 * ## The write gap is real and is not papered over
 *
 * The consumer key in use can read customers. Creating one through the REST API
 * requires the *write* scope on the same key, and this store's key was issued for
 * the catalogue and orders work; the console therefore does not offer "add
 * customer" rather than offering a button whose request the store would refuse.
 * Customer accounts are created by signing up, which is the WordPress/WooCommerce
 * account path.
