/**
 * Where a new page starts, and where a returning one resumes.
 *
 * Two things made navigation feel heavy here:
 *
 *  1. `behavior: 'smooth'` animated the jump to the top on every route change.
 *     Opening a link from halfway down a long page meant watching the viewport
 *     travel back up while the new page was already rendering — a second of
 *     motion where the expectation is that the new page simply starts at its
 *     beginning. Smooth belongs to in-page anchors, not to changing page.
 *
 *  2. `scrollRestoration = 'manual'` plus an unconditional scroll to top meant
 *     Back landed at the top of the previous page rather than at the spot it
 *     was left. Leaving restoration on the browser default hands that back:
 *     it remembers the position for history entries, and only forward
 *     navigations — which have no remembered position — are sent to the top
 *     here.
