# Staging migration status

Branch `integration/cloudflare-workers-migration`. Staging backend is WooCommerce
at `https://himalayankoh.com/staging`. Production is read-only throughout.

- Deployed Worker (staging): `https://himalayan-koh-ecommerce.8002salman.workers.dev`
- Deployment method: `vinext` + Cloudflare Workers (see `CLOUDFLARE-MIGRATION.md`)
- Cutover target: `preview.himalayankoh.com` — **not switched yet**

## Environment / secret matrix

Nothing above is committed. The credential file the owner supplied lives **outside
the git repository** (parent directory), and `.env.local`, `.dev.vars` and
`.dev.vars.*` are gitignored.

## Verified on the deployed Worker

Full suite, commit `4fbc39f` (`/api/version` reports the same SHA):

- 25/25 routes answer; `/checkout` now renders a real checkout page (it used to be
  shadowed by a legacy redirect — see the commit for the cause).
- Noindex on every route including `/`; `robots.txt` disallows all.
- Public niche sweep: 0 forbidden matches. Public secret sweep: 0 matches.
- Catalog: 18 authorised SKUs public with live Woo prices; 0 duplicate SKUs.
- Crafted URLs for retired livestock products still 308 to the catalogue.

## Open blocker: the checkout chain is not verifiable

`product → cart → checkout → Stripe → Woo order → My Orders → Shippo` was **not**
verified, and cannot be, for two separate reasons:

1. **No Stripe credentials exist at all** — not in the repo env, not in the Vercel
   project, not in the Worker. There is no test key to charge and no publishable
   key to render a card form.
2. **The only Shippo key is a live key** (`shippo_live_…`). Per the owner's own
   instruction, a live-only shipping credential means the integration test stops
   and is reported rather than exercised.

Independently of credentials, the write path for orders is still Supabase: cart,
`orders/create`, `stripe/create-payment-intent`, `stripe/webhook`,
`shippo/create-label` and `lib/orders/serverCreateOrder.ts` all read and write the
legacy database. WooCommerce is authoritative for products, prices, stock,
categories and coupon/order *reads*; it is **not** yet the order write target. That
is a dual source of truth and is recorded here rather than quietly left.

## Owner decisions resolved (2026-09-18)

1. **The five legacy records are hidden.** `2321`, `2352`, `2372`, `2446`, `2461`
   left the public catalog. They were set to `draft` in WooCommerce — **not**
   deleted or trashed, so their ids, slugs and history survive — and they were
   added to `OWNER_REJECTED_PRODUCT_IDS` so the exclusion also holds if one is ever
   republished. They were hidden rather than renamed because the decision was about
   the records: all five are pink-salt products in substance, and `2446`/`2321`
   closely resemble authorised SKUs at different prices. The authorised SKUs are the
   catalog that replaces them.
2. **Stripe stays unverified.** The owner has ruled out live credentials for
   staging, and no test keys exist. Order: test keys arrive → staging-only
   end-to-end. Until then checkout's payment leg is **NOT VERIFIED**, not "passing".
3. **Shippo stays unexercised.** The only key is live (`shippo_live_…`), so the
   owner's instruction is to wait for a test token rather than buy a label.
4. **Server credentials no longer reach the build artifact.** The Cloudflare Vite
   plugin stages the project's `.dev.vars` beside its generated Worker config, so
   `dist/server/.dev.vars` held the WooCommerce key/secret and the Shippo key — never
   served, never uploaded, but live credentials inside a build artifact are one
   stray upload from publication. Every build now deletes env files from the output
   and searches what remains for this machine's server-only values, failing on a hit
   (`scripts/check-build-secrets.mjs`). It compares real values instead of guessing
   at patterns, never prints one, and treats `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` and `SHIPPO_FROM_*` as
   public by intent — the shipping-from address is advertised on Contact and in the
   policies.

## Staging-safe technical cleanup (2026-09-18)

- **`next-env.d.ts` is untracked.** Two toolchains own that filename and write
  different contents (`vinext build` imports its own type augmentations, `next lint`
  restores Next's navigation types), so a tracked copy came back dirty after a lint
  run. Typecheck passes without the file — verified with `.next/types` removed — and
  both build tools write it back before anything needs it. A full `npm run build`
  and `npm run build:deploy` now leave a **clean tree**.
- **Nothing in the app asks about Vercel any more.** The AI route's CORS allowlist
  read `VERCEL_URL`/`VERCEL_PROJECT_PRODUCTION_URL` and fell back to the literal
  `himalayan-koh.vercel.app`; on Workers those are absent, so it was effectively
  asking whether a caller was the old Vercel host. It now allows the origin the
  deployment is served from (from the request's own URL) plus the configured public
  origin — verified on the Worker: own host and preview reflected, `evil.example` and
  `someone-elses-app.vercel.app` get no CORS header at all.
- **`images.remotePatterns` no longer wildcards `**.vercel.app`**, a shared domain
  nothing has referenced since content moved to WooCommerce.
- **`robots` meta is denial-only** (see the commit): staging pages were emitting
  `index, follow` while their own headers said `noindex, nofollow`. All three signals
  now agree on every route; `/login` and `/account` keep an explicit denial so they
  stay out of the index on production too.
- **Credentials are checked at build *and* deploy.** The plugin re-stages
  `.dev.vars` into `dist/server` when the deploy runs, so a build-time-only guard
  left the artifact dirty again before it shipped. `deploy:vinext` runs the check
  afterwards, which also leaves `dist` clean at rest.
- **Deploy propagation.** A deploy can answer from the previous version for a few
  seconds; `/api/version` read immediately after a deploy returned the *old* SHA
  before settling. Poll it, do not single-shot it.

## Still outstanding

- **`HK-LFH-6lbs` price conflict** — the workbook disagrees with itself (Sheet1
  $12.75/$19.95 vs Sheet2 $10.75/$17.95). Created as `draft`, flagged `OWNER PRICE
  CONFIRMATION REQUIRED`, not published, so it is the one authorised SKU that is not
  publicly visible.

## Cutover performed (2026-09-18): preview.himalayankoh.com → Cloudflare

| | |
| --- | --- |
| PREVIEW DNS BEFORE | CNAME `preview.himalayankoh.com` → `cname.vercel-dns.com`, **DNS-only**, id `2d8c5d2efab86a18e0331b096e25ccfa` |
| PREVIEW DNS AFTER | Cloudflare-managed Worker custom domain: `AAAA preview → 100::` proxied, plus the edge A records; `Server: cloudflare`, `CF-RAY` present |
| SERVED BY | **Cloudflare Worker**, not Vercel |
| WORKER (staging) | `himalayan-koh-ecommerce` in `Himalayankoh.pk@gmail.com`'s account (`fd383fa3284298b20cd3ca9ba8b1dffa`), custom domain id `1e237b316fa58c02c308b08ed0327eb31ad5ff81` |
| KV namespace | `VINEXT_KV_CACHE` `7e62970fbe5049dfb678409d6f28d064` (created in that account for this move) |
| Deployed SHA | `02a42a12afcc9cadb681cfaa2b812719724df63b`, equal to git `HEAD` at deploy time (`/api/version`) |

### Why the Worker moved accounts

A Worker custom domain requires the zone and the Worker to be in the **same** Cloudflare
account. `himalayankoh.com` lives in `Himalayankoh.pk@gmail.com`'s account; the staging
Worker was first deployed into `8002salman@gmail.com`'s account
(`f542683e97458480452b0b8ef37a898a`), which cannot see that zone at all (it sees only
`luxedge.us`). The Worker was therefore deployed into the zone's account and the custom
domain attached there. The earlier deployment is **untouched and still serving** on
`https://himalayan-koh-ecommerce.8002salman.workers.dev` as rollback.

### Which token does what (probed, not assumed)

The three supplied tokens each hold about half of what a cutover needs:

| Capability | token 1 | token 2 | token 3 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Workers scripts / KV **read** | ✅ | ✅ | partial |
| Deploy (assets upload session) | ❌ 403 | ✅ | ❌ 403 |
| KV namespace create/delete | ❌ 401 | ✅ | ❌ |
| Worker **custom domain attach** (`PUT`) | ❌ 403 | ✅ | ❌ |
| Zone **DNS write** | ❌ 403 | ❌ 403 | ✅ |
| Zone DNS read | ✅ | ❌ 403 | ✅ |
| Worker routes write | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ |

So the cutover used **token 3 to remove the Vercel CNAME** and **token 2 to attach the
custom domain**. Two details worth keeping: the attach endpoint is `PUT` (a `POST`
answers `405 Method not allowed for this authentication scheme`, which reads like a
permission problem and is not), and the attach refuses while any externally managed
DNS record holds the name (`409 100117`), so the record must be removed first.

### Verified after the cutover

Against `https://preview.himalayankoh.com` itself (pinned resolver while this machine's
cache still held the pre-cutover answer — the authoritative and public answers already
returned Cloudflare): `server: cloudflare`, no `X-Vercel-*`, `/api/version` = git HEAD,
all of `/ /products /about /contact /faqs /blog /checkout /login /account /admin
/sitemap.xml /robots.txt` = 200, 120 unique internal links all 200, approved homepage
copy present ("World's Best for Livestock", "Rich All Natural Himalayan Pink Salt",
"horses, cattle and deer"), 18 published SKUs each rendering their own price and SKU,
the five retired records absent from sitemap and listing, `HK-LFH-6lbs` still draft,
canonical and sitemap origin = `preview.himalayankoh.com`, `noindex, nofollow` +
`Disallow: /`, no permitting robots meta, no credential shapes in HTML.

DNS integrity: comparing the zone against the pre-cutover snapshot shows **exactly one**
record changed — the preview hostname. Apex `A`, `www` CNAME, `mail`/`webmail` `A`, all
three `MX`, the SPF `TXT` and the DKIM `TXT` are byte-identical to before.

### Rollback

```
1. delete the custom domain      PUT-less: DELETE /accounts/<fd383fa…>/workers/domains/1e237b316fa58c02c308b08ed0327eb31ad5ff81
                                 (token 2; see .freebuff/cf-cutover.mjs)
2. recreate the CNAME record     CNAME preview.himalayankoh.com -> cname.vercel-dns.com,
                                 proxied=false, ttl=1 (token 3)
```

The exact record is in `.freebuff/preview-cutover-snapshot.json`
(`removedRecord`) and `.freebuff/preview-rollback-state.json`. Vercel was not modified:
the old deployment and the `himalayan-koh.vercel.app` alias still serve, so the rollback
restores a working preview rather than needing a rebuild. A fuller rollback also means
reverting the `kv_namespaces` id in `wrangler.jsonc` and deploying back into
`8002salman`'s account, whose Worker still holds its own binding and secrets.

### Deploy recipe now

```
cd himalayan-koh
eval "$(node ../.freebuff/cf-env.mjs)"   # token 2 + the zone account, no OAuth needed
npm run build:deploy
npx vinext-cloudflare deploy --config dist/server/wrangler.json
```

## Rollback state (captured before any cutover)

`preview.himalayankoh.com` is a **DNS-only (unproxied) CNAME**:

```
id      2d8c5d2efab86a18e0331b096e25ccfa
type    CNAME
content cname.vercel-dns.com
proxied false
comment "Vercel preview storefront (noindex-guarded)"
```

Reverting the cutover means restoring exactly that record. Apex `A`, `www` CNAME,
MX (`*.jellyfish.systems`) and the SPF/DKIM TXT records are untouched by this
migration and must stay untouched.
